## How to use it

The `.jar` should be placed in the root folder of the game.

When it's run for the first time it'll create a `mods` folder there, that's where you can drag `.mod` files and their corresponding `.cfg` files.

When you restart the program it'll add these mods to the dropdown menu from where you can install and uninstall them with ease.

## Example mods
Some example mods are included in the 'example' folder.
These might be unstable and crash your game so proceed with caution.
